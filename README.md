# Troll GUI

> Warning: Use responsibly. This GUI bites.

This is a playful Python GUI that multiplies like a gremlin when you try to close it or hover over its deceptive center button. It's designed as a tongue-in-cheek prank and a personal project to practice GUI programming.

## ðŸš€ Features

  - Try to close the main window
  - Hover over the central button
- The only way to exit is to **press `q`**â€”no other escape!

## ðŸ§ª Built With

- Python 3
- Tkinter (standard GUI library)

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Run

```bash
python troll_gui.py
```
